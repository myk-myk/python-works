# eight-puzzle
My implementation of an eight puzzle problem made with *Python* using different algorithms.                
Python version: *3.9.7*.            
Input and output menus in programs are in the *Ukrainian* language.               
Class **'Tree'** is used for *building a search tree* and for *measuring the depth* of every state.             
All states that the program goes through are written into a **'states.txt'** file with some additional information (*depth* or *heuristic function value*).            
Files **'states.txt'** located in each folder are *examples of program work* and they show how the files look like.              

- The **'BFS'** folder contains a *breadth-first search* algorithm for eight puzzle problem.           
- The **'DFS'** folder contains a *depth-first search* algorithm for eight puzzle problem.                  
- The **'A_star'** folder contains the *A\** algorithm for eight puzzle problem.
