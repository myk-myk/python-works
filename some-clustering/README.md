# some-clustering
My implementation of several clustering methods made with Python.
Python version: 3.9.7.
An output menu in programs is in the Ukrainian language.
The visualisation of clustering results is done using matplotlib.
Files 'points.txt' located in each folder are examples of input points the program works with and they show what the input files' structure should look like.
Current version of code only works with 2D dimention: p(x, y).

The 'max-min' folder contains a max-min clustering algorithm.

The 'k-means' folder contains the k-means clustering algorithm.

The 'ISODATA' folder contains the ISODATA clustering algorithm.

The '2_clusters-perceptron' folder contains the perceptron clustering algorithm for 2 clusters only.

The 'perceptron' folder contains the perceptron clustering algorithm for any amount of clusters.
